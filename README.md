# Numberguess-game
Hello there!, this is a fun little game where you have to guess a number selected by the program between 1-100 and in the first try if you get it within the range of 10 it returns 'warm' or else 'cold' and from the 2nd try if you get your guess closer to the actual number it displays 'warmer' or 'colder' in the opposite case.

And again this is not my idea as even might know and even might have coded this game while you were learning a language ;)
